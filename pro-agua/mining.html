          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The Amazon rainforest plays a vital role not just to South America
            but to the entire world. It represents over half of the planet's
            remaining rainforest and comprises one of the largest and most
            biodiverse ecosystems in the world. However the gold mining activity
            is destroying this ecosystem.<br /><br />
            This visualization shows the evolution of the mining activity in the
            Peruvian Amazon forest. In the year 2017, gold mining has destroyed
            almost
            <b id="value_counter_0"> 10000</b> hectares of rainforest in the
            Peruvian Amazon region, almost the size of Paris of rainforest was
            destroyed. <br /><br />
            This activity is not only destroying the rainforest, which is
            considered as the "lung of the world" because of the key role it
            represents fighting the climate change, but is also contaminating
            the soil and rivers with toxic compounds that are used to extract
            and processed the gold, which are dragged by the rivers to the
            nearest towns where high levels of mercury have been detected and
            menacing both terrestrial and aquatic life.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are two different types of mining types in the Amazonia:
            <mark class="hm_text"> “Heavy Machinery“ </mark> that uses big
            trucks and heavy machines to extract the gold from the soil, and
            <mark class="sp_text">“Suction Pumps”</mark> which is composed of
            washers and more traditional methods to extract the gold.

          <h2><b>1985</b></h2>
          <p>
            The first record of gold mining at this region is in 1985, as you
            can see in the map it started with 73.9 ha and distributed between
            the sectors : Huepetuhe, Delta and Small Mines. <br /><br />
            At this time the sector with the highest percentage of mining
            activity was :
            <mark class="hm_text huepetuhe">Huepetue-Heavy Machinery</mark>
            with <b id="value_counter_11"> 35.73 </b> <b>ha</b>. The relation
            between the two different mining methods was
            <b id="value_counter_12">55</b><b>%</b>
            <b>for Heavy Machinery </b> and 45% for Suction Pumps.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="container2" class="story-container">
          <h2><b>1993</b></h2>
          <p>
            In the year 1993, we can observe an alarming increase in mining
            activity, with a total increase of
            <b id="value_counter_21">1036</b><b>%</b>. The area of the mining
            activity was <b id="value_counter_22">839.5</b>
            <b>ha</b> distributed between the sectors: Huepetuhe, Delta and
            small mines.

            <br /><br />As you can observe the sector with the highest
            percentage remain as
            <b>

            </b>
            with <b id="value_counter_23">695.6</b> <b>ha</b>, this method had
            83% of the total mining area at that time. This was the preferred
            method to extract gold at this time, which can be confirmed
            comparing the increase in percentage compared to the previous year
            with an incredible <b id="value_counter_24">1618</b>%.

            The things remain almost the same in 2001 in terms of total area
            used for mining with an increase of
            <b id="value_counter_31">10</b><b>%</b> with a total of 919.6 ha.
            <br /><br />However if we go deeper into the data we can see that we
            had an abrupt change between the preferred method to mine the gold
            <b> <mark class="sp_text">Suction Pumps</mark> </b> had a total of

            <mark class="sp_text smallmines">small mines </mark> . And the Heavy

        <div id="container4" class="story-container">
          <h2><b>2009</b></h2>
          <p>
            In 2009 the increase of mining activity compared to 1985 was
            alarming, an increase of 151% over the area used for mining, a total
            of <b id="value_counter_41">2304.6 </b> <b>ha</b> of the Peruvian
            Amazon rainforest was destroyed and contaminated because of the gold
            mining. The sectors where the mining was done: Huepetuhe, Delta,
            Pampa, and small mines. The sector with the highest percentage was :
            <b>
              <mark class="sp_text pampa">Pampa-Suction Pumps mining</mark>
            </b>
            with <b id="value_counter_42">962.47</b> <b>ha</b>. <br />The
            relation between the two different mining methods was 20%-80% for
            heavy machinery and suction pumps. We can see that the suction pump
            remains as the main method for mining the gold. We have an increase
            of 161% for suction pumps with a total of
            <b id="value_counter_43"> 1846.1</b> <b>ha</b> and an increase of
            117% for heavy machinery and a total of 458.4 ha

        <div id="container5" class="story-container">
          <h2><b>2017</b></h2>
          <p>
            In 2017 things became critical, the gold mining activity had an
            increase of 328% compared to 2009, with an area of
            <b id="value_counter_51">9859.8</b> <b>ha</b>, almost the size of
            Paris of Peruvian Amazon rainforest was destroyed and contaminated.
            At this moment the activity was distributed over the sectors:
            Huepetuhe, Delta, Pampa, and small mines. The sector with the
            highest percentage of mining is
            <mark class="sp_text pampa"> Small Mines-Suction Pumps</mark>
            <b id="value_counter_52"> 4486.9</b> <b>ha</b>.

            <br />The relation between the two different mining methods was
            34%-66% for heavy machinery and suction pumps. We can see that the
            suction pump is the main method for mining gold, with an increase of
            252% and a total of 6497.5 ha compared to an increase of 633% for
            heavy machinery and a total of 3362.3 ha.
