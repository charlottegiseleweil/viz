#  Visualizing Nature’s Contributions to People worldwide, today and in 2050


## Description

This viewer supports the **Global Modeling of Nature’s Contributions to People**, described by Chaplin-Kramer et al (in review). Natural habitats purifies water, protects us from floods, delivers pollinators to food crops supporting nutritious diets, and provides countless other benefits to humanity Incorporating nature’s contribution to people into decision making is essential to face the 21st century challenges. The forthcoming Global Assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services (IPBES) illuminates where nature is contributing the most to meet our needs and where it could be at risk. As part of this effort, we mapped key ecosystem services worldwide at a fine resolution, under future scenarios.
The complexity of multi-dimensional results leads to many possible narratives: the high-resolution and multi-dimensionality of these global spatial results makes them particularly dense, interesting and complex. Indeed, the data may be analyzed under many interesting angles: exploring humanity’s need for nature, change in the nature’s contribution to meeting that need, the amount of unmet need remaining, the number of people impacted, as well as comparisons across different regions, services, scenarios.
The goal of this interactive viewer (tailored to the specific needs of this complex data) is to facilitate the exploration of the results under different angles, allowing decision-makers to draw relevant insights (e.g identify areas where people are most vulnerable): informing science-based policies, with the right maps in the right hands.

## Prototype

The visualization prototype is accessible [here](https://charlottegiseleweil.github.io/natureforpeople).


## Structure

* **today.html** offers on overview of the areas where Nature's Contribution to People (NCP) is key, for the 3 types of NCP studied: Pollination, Coastal Protection and Water Quality.
* The 3 subpages, **pollination.html**, **waterquality.html** and **coastal.html** respectively dive in each NCP, with detailed results in terms of humanity's needs and nature's contributions, as well as methodology.


## Data
All data displayed is publicly available [here](http://ipbes-natcap-ecoshard-data-for-publication.ecoshard.org/)
