<br> 
<br> &bull; The user may go through cases either by using the left and right arrows, or by selecting them in the left-hand menu.
<br> &bull; The right-hand side panel (here) displays content specific to the case being viewed. It offers a brief summary of the case and, when available, images, figures, legends, and buttons.
<br> &bull; The left-hand side menu is for navigation. It contains buttons to: 
<br> &nbsp; &mdash; Go back to this view 
<br> &nbsp; &mdash; Start a more descriptive tutorial  
<br> &nbsp; &mdash; Read something about us  
<br> &nbsp; &mdash; Select and track the chapters. Each chapter contains one or multiple case studies. These will be displayed in a sub-menu once the chapter is selected. The cases with a red border contain a dynamic figure.
<br> &nbsp; &mdash; Open a window presenting the types of mechanisms that case studies use in the book.
<br> &bull; The center displays a map of the world. The focus of the map will change according to the case being viewed. It is also possible to click on a country to explore only the cases present in that country.
