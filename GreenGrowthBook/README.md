## Green Growth That Works
Green Growth the Works provides a practical guide to the policies and finance mechanisms for securing and enhancing natural capital and ecosystem service benefits around the world. Through a series of case studies – contributed by experts from the natural and social sciences, government, private companies, financial institutions, and civil society organizations – Green Growth the Works addresses key questions including: How can economic and other incentives be channeled to make conservation and restoration attractive and mainstream? Which approaches have been successful, under what conditions? What roles can governments, businesses, landowners, nongovernmental organizations, and other actors play, and how can they complement each other? What are the opportunities to scale and improve these successful models?

## History of the project

* 2017: The Natural Capital Project, strong of 12 years of experience mainstreaming the value of nature into finance and policy, welcomes the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a new partner. At this occasion, Lisa Mandle (Natural Capital Project) compiles case studies to share experience and lessons learned from various diversified mechanisms for protecting, enhancing and investing in the value of natural capital and ecosystem services. The resulting publication is produced as part of a collaborative effort among the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NDRC), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Natural Capital Project, and the Paulson Institute. While working on illustrations for this book, Charlotte Weil (Natural Capital Project) imagines and designs an interactive viewer to explore the case studies

* 2018: This compilation of international case studies is of utmost interest to many; the book is enhanced and being adapted for an international audience. As the publisher Island Press is working on it, a prototype of the interactive book explorer is developed in the scope of EPFL Data Visualization course (COM-480) by Can, Gunes and Cyril: https://schreven.github.io/Map-intl-env-projects/src/index.html (Project report: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WU9sILkX6wAXK3CFvv_4IRCCQ1SDDjsW)

* 2019: The book explorer is turned into an online supplement for the book, and presented at the Natural Capital Symposium, Stanford University. The book will be released in summer.
